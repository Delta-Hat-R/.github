# Delta Hat GitHub Orgainisation

## About 

An experience-led company specialising in the technical aspects of evidence-based medicine and health technology assessment. 

[deltahat.com](www.deltahat.com)

This organisation is where we store our code repositories. We create one respository per project and primarily code in R. 

## Rules / good practice 

- "Pull" before starting work - people not pulling before they work can cause merge conflicts within a single branch.
- Working on the correct branch - people  working within a branch pushing changes without communicating with others can cause issues.
- Using branches correctly - people continuing to work within branches that were deleted following a merging of a pull request can cause issues.
- Making new branches - always double check that you are branching from the correct (and most up to date version of the) branch

## Example code

We encourage everyone to collaborate, share and recycle code where possible. It is rare that you will start a project using a method or approach that no one else has done before. Some examples of projects that have example code for certain methods/approaches is included below. Related to this, the same goes for generating figures/tables. The likelihood is that someone has code to generate a figure similar to what you might be looking to do. Instead of an exhaustive list below, try using the search function within this Delta-Hat-R GitHub organisation at the top of the page. If you need code to generate a forest plot, try seaarching "forest" in the search bar and have a look through the code. If you find something and are unsure, contact the author of the code directly to discuss.
