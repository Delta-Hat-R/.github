## Rules / good practice 

people not pulling before they work and causing massive merge conflicts within a single branch
people just working within a branch I just asked them not to work within and pushing changes without telling me
people continuing to work within branches that were deleted following a merging of a pull request
people making a branch from the wrong branch and then asking me why the code isn't "up to date", so I then have to do a manual merge or delete their new branch and make it for them by branching form the correct branch
people just deciding to build massive loads of code without making a new branch to do that in
base for loops that are super slow and hard to read...so, so many of those
