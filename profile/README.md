This organisation is where we store our code repositories. We create one respository per project and primarily code in R. 

## Rules / good practice 

- "Pull" before starting work - people not pulling before they work can cause merge conflicts within a single branch.
- Working on the correct branch - people  working within a branch pushing changes without communicating with others can cause issues.
- Using branches correctly - people continuing to work within branches that were deleted following a merging of a pull request can cause issues.
- Making new branches - always double check that you are branching from the correct (and most up to date version of the) branch
